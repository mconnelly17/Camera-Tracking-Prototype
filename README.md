# Introduction & Goals
Cameras are an important part of the sporting industry as they are the intermediary between the action and the fanâ€‹. With this, it is important that the camera be centered on what people care about, such as a ball or an important player. To avoid needing a camera operator, our team has developed a prototype that centers the camera on a selected object automatically. The goal of our project is to create a camera tracking prototype that can be used with multiple types of selected objects. The prototype should center the selected object in the center of the frame, putting emphasis on what is important. The actors used in our project were 2 stepper motors, the sensors used in our project were a camera and an ambient light sensor (ALS), and our advanced mechatronics topic was machine vision.
